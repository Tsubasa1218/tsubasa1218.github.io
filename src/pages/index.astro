		<h2>Work Experience</h2>
		<ExperienceEntry place="TrueContext" title="Senior Software Engineer" date="June 2023 - May 2025">
			<li>Led the development and redesign of the most active view of the Form Builder application, leading to a 30% reduction in LoC as well as the introduction of new multi-editing capabilities</li>
			<li>Conducted customer interviews, resulting in several improvements to the UX in key areas of customer facing applications</li>
			<li>Mentored new team members through pair programming sessions, code reviews, and in-person conversations</li>
			<li>
				Focused heavily on improving the DX by actively updating (and/or removing) libraries, notably:
				<ul>
					<li>Redux to Redux Toolkit, resulting in a 35% reduction in LoC and a streamlined reducer coding style</li>
					<li>Webpack to Vite, ESBuild, and Rollup, leading to millisecond start-up and hot-reload times and introduction of TypeScript into the codebases</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Researched methods to improve and simplify our existing React and JSP front-ends, as well as AI solutions to automatic form generation (see Education)
			</li>

		<ExperienceEntry place="TrueContext" title="Software Engineer" date="July 2020 - May 2023">
			<li>{SAME}</li>
			<li>Developed API end-points and validation rules in the Java backend</li>
			<li>Architected the component structure of a new application used for trial sign-ups</li>
			<li>Continuously refactored our CI/CD pipelines to reduce re-run times after failures</li>
			<li>Reduced the bundle size of web-based forms by 45%, improving load times</li>
			<li>Increased testing coverage of web-based forms from ~1K to ~10K tests by abstracting parameterized tests, resulting in near-zero escalations from 2021 to 2025</li>

		<h2>Education</h2>
		<ExperienceEntry place="Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia" title="MSc. Smart Application Development" date="2024 - Paused">
			<li><b>Project</b>: parsing a form in a PDF or Image using AI tools like AWS Textract (and/or Hugging Face) to generate a JSON representation of it for further ingestion by TrueContext systems</li>
		</ExperienceEntry>

		<ExperienceEntry place="Universidad del Valle, Cali, Colombia" title="Systems Engineering" date="2014 - 2019">
			<li>Developed a game in Unity 3D to convey basic English vocabulary, focusing on gameplay driven by (Deep) Reinforcement Learning using Unity Agents (C#) and the <i>Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic</i> algorithm (Python), as well as simpler methods like heuristics</li>
			<li>Teaching Assistant of: Introduction to Programming (Python, Ruby), Numerical Methods (C++, SciLab), and Introduction to Digital Image Processing (C++, Java)</li>

		<h2>Personal Projects</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Airbus A320 Control for X-Plane 12</b>: Usage of X-Plane's websocket server to interact with an A320 simulation using a web application built in Svelte. The goal is to create a physical button box using ESP32 modules and the newer Rust HAL. Also uses LangChain to create and query a vector database containing all the information provided by the simulator
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Basic Conditional Logic Runtime</b>: Signal's based reactive system in C++21 to update questions in THEN statements when IF statement predicates met
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Ray-tracing In One Weekend</b>: Translated the suggested C++ implemention into Zig as a learning exercise
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Flux Pattern</b>: Implemented the Flux pattern (used by ReduxJS) in Rust as a learning exercise to better understand the trade-offs of different Form Definition representations
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Air Quality Sensor</b>: Modified sample Arduino code to send air quality data to a self-hosted Rust-based server for storage - using SQLite - and further display in a dashboard-like UI
			</li>
